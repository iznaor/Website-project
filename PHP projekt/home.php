      <p>Champagne sales are on the rise, surging back to numbers last seen before the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns sent sales plummeting, as people were banned from throwing parties.
 Champagne sales are on course to reach a four-year high this year, thanks to exports to the United States and Australia, French champagne wine growers lobby SGV said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Sales between January and August soared 11.9%, even compared to the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. French champagne houses shipped 297.6 million bottles globally. In 2020, however, the region exported only 244 million bottles, according to data from the Comite Champagne trade association.</p>
      <p>Turnover for the sector, which is Frances second-biggest export industry after aeronautics, showed a loss in profits of $980 million. The category was down almost 18% last year after declines of 2% in 2019, an analyst from UK-based International Wines and Spirits Record (IWSR) told CNBC, citing the groups Drinks Market Analysis figures. Now, based on the current increase, the firm expects champagne sales to grow about 4% this year, and continue the trend through 2025.</p>
      <p>French General Syndicate of Champagne Winegrowers is optimistic, the group expects that the current rally in global champagne markets may propel sales to 305 million bottles worldwide in 2021. Some experts believe that people are simply ready to party again after spending over a year locked down.
